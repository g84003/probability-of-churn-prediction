# probability-of-churn-prediction
The gym chain Model Fitness is developing a customer interaction strategy based on analytical data.

One of the most common problems gyms and other services face is customer churn.
Churn indicators vary from field to field.
For a gym, it makes sense to say a customer has left if they don't come for a month.
In order to fight churn, Model Fitness has digitized a number of its customer profiles. The task is to analyze them and come up with a customer retention strategy.

Model Fitness provided the dataset including the following fields:
'Churn' — the fact of churn for the month in question <br>
Current dataset fields:<br>
User data for the preceding month<br>
'gender'<br>
'Near_Location' — whether the user lives or works in the neighborhood where the gym is located<br>
'Partner' — whether the user is an employee of a partner company (the gym has partner companies whose employees get discounts; in those cases the gym stores information on customers' employers)<br>
Promo_friends — whether the user originally signed up through a "bring a friend" offer (they used a friend's promo code when paying for their first membership)<br>
'Phone' — whether the user provided their phone number<br>
'Age'<br>
'Lifetime' — the time (in months) since the customer first came to the gym<br>
Data from the log of visits and purchases and data on current membership status<br>
'Contract_period' — 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, or 1 year<br>
'Month_to_end_contract' — the months remaining until the contract expires<br>
'Group_visits' — whether the user takes part in group sessions<br>
'Avg_class_frequency_total' — average frequency of visits per week over the customer's lifetime<br>
'Avg_class_frequency_current_month' — average frequency of visits per week over the preceding month<br>
'Avg_additional_charges_total' — the total amount of money spent on other gym services: cafe, athletic goods, cosmetics, massages, etc.<br>
